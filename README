A learning implementation of a CSS selector engine. It will work in Firefox 3 and Safari so far, not sure about anything else.

Just call:
hassle("selector")
and you'll get back an array of matching elements!
You can also call hassle(element) to get an array containing that element, or hassle("selector", element) to only find elements in that element's subtree

Current selectors supported:
===Basics======
#id
	Matches a single element with the given id attribute
element
	Matches all elements with the given name
.class
	Matches all elements with the given class
.class1.class2
	Matches all elements with all the given classes
*
	Matches all elements
selector1, selector2, selectorN
	Matches the combined results of all the specified selectors

===Hierarchy======
ancestor descendant
	Matches all descendant elements specified by "descendant" of elements specified by "ancestor"
parent > child
	Matches all child elements specified by "child" of elements specified by "parent"

===Attribute Filters======
[attribute]
	Matches elements that have the specified attribute
