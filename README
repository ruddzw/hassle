A learning implementation of a CSS selector engine. It will work in Firefox 3 and Safari so far, not sure about anything else.

Just call:
hassle("selector")
and you'll get back an array of matching elements!
You can also call hassle(element) to get an array containing that element, or hassle("selector", element) to only find elements in that element's subtree

Current selectors supported:
tag names
comma separation
#id
.class
contextual selectors
> children
any combination of the above!
